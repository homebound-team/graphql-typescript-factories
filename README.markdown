# graphql-typescript-factories

This project is a plugin for [graphql-code-generator](http://www.graphql-code-generator.com) that generates `new<Foo>` factory methods for use in client-side GraphQL tests that are stubbing/mocking out GraphQL responses.

I.e. for a given schema like:

```graphql
type Author {
  name: String!
  summary: AuthorSummary!
  popularity: Popularity!
  working: Working
  birthday: Date
}

# A DTO that is just some fields
type AuthorSummary {
  author: Author!
  numberOfBooks: Int!
  amountOfSales: Float
}
```

You'll get a factory method (generated in your regular `graphql-types.ts` output file) that let's you "one liner" create an `Author` with sane defaults:

```typescript
const author = newAuthor();

expect(author.__typename).toEqual("Author")
expect(author.name).toEqual("name")
expect(author.summary.author).toStrictEqual(author);
expect(author.summary.numberOfBooks).toEqual(0);
```

You can also override properties that are specific to your use case:

```typescript
const author = newAuthor({ name: "long name" });

expect(author.__typename).toEqual("Author")
expect(author.name).toEqual("name")
```

## Install

```shell
npm -i @homebound/graphql-typescript-factories
```

### Use

Since this is a plugin, make sure you have `graphql-codegen` installed prior to using this package

Include the plugin in your `graphql-codegen.yml` config file:

```yaml
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.json
generates:
  src/generated/graphql-types.tsx:
    config:
      withHOC: false
      withHooks: true
      avoidOptionals: true
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - "@homebound/graphql-typescript-factories"
```

**Note**: The factories created by this plugin use the `Author`/etc. types generated by the regular `typescript` plugin, so you should have that included too.

If your usecase (e.g. you want to only have the factories defined in a testing package) requires the types and the factories to be defined in separate files, then you could avoid using `typescript` by defining the path to the file containing the type declarations using `typeFilePath` field in the config. Optionally, you can also define the import name used for those types through the `typeImportName` field.

**Things to note:**
- Defining `typeImportName` while `typeFilePath` is not defined has no effect on the generated output.

- If your project requires extensionless imports, please leave out the `.ts(x)` extensions in the file path. Otherwise, like projects that are ESM compliant, please keep the file extensions in the path.

```yaml
overwrite: true
schema: ./schema.json
generates:
  src/generated/graphql-types-only.tsx:
    config:
      withHOC: false
      withHooks: true
      avoidOptionals: true
    plugins:
      - typescript
  src/generated/graphql-type-factories.tsx:
    config:
      typeFilePath: "src/generated/graphql-types-only"
      typeImportName: "FooModule" # Optional: defaults to 'GraphQLAutoGeneratedTypes'
    plugins:
      - "@homebound/graphql-typescript-factories"
```

## Enum Details Pattern

Somewhat tangentially, we've added first-class handling of our Homebound-specific "Enum Detail" pattern, where instead of returning enum values directly, we wrap the enum with a detail object that adds the string name, so that the client doesn't have to have its own boilerplate "enum to name" mapping. I.e. this schema:

```graphql
enum EmployeeStatus { FULL_TIME, PART_TIME }
  
type EmployeeStatusDetail {
  code: EmployeeStatus!
  name: String!
}

type Employee {
  status: EmployeeStatusDetail
}
```

Allows a client to use the "enum detail" object to get other information than just the code.

(Currently we only support an additional `name` field, but the intent would be to add more business-logic-y things to the detail object that is information the client might need, without having to hard-code `switch` statements on the client-side).

Currently, any GraphQL object that has exactly two fields, named `code` and `name`, is assumed to be an Enum Detail wrapper.

Once these wrapper types are recognized, we add some syntax sugar that allows creating objects with the enum itself as a shortcut, i.e.:

```typescript
const employee = newEmployee({
  status: EmployeeStatus.FULL_TIME,
});
```

Will work even though `status` is technically a `EmployeeStatusDetail` object and not the `EmployeeStatus` enum directly.

If this feature/pattern is problematic for users who don't use it, we can add a config flag to disable it.

## Contributing

In order to develop changes for this package, follow these steps:

1. Make your desired changes in the [`src` directory](/src)

2. Adjust the example files under the [`integration` directory](/integration) to use your new feature.

3. Run `npm run build`, to create a build with your changes

4. Run `npm run graphql-codegen`, and verify the output

## Todo

- Support "number of children"
- Support customizations like "if building DAG, reuse same project vs. make new project teach time"
- Support providing a level of the DAG N-levels away (i.e. "create project but use this for the task")
